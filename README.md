# Full Stack Movie Review Site

## Goal
Adding JPA functionality to a website I developed to store reviews and test knowledge of TDD, Spring bootstrapping, Thymeleaf templates, html and CSS.

Tags and Categories added to reviews as JPA entities.


## Usage
Visit at https://review-site-full-stack.herokuapp.com/ or
Run the Java application, which creates a menu at localhost:8080/

Click into any review to read the content. Click any tag or category to see a list of reviews that share the tag or category.
All reviews with credit to the users at IMDb. All images from Creative Commons image search.
